# Open source software template

This is the basic config you'll need in a repository on GitHub for an open source project. Suggestions welcome read over the [contributing](/CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines.

I'm trying to keep this as generic as possible, with more focused forks of this repository listed below.

## Install

Nothing to install, just copy to new folder.

## Usage

These are meant to be templates, including this readme. Copy to a new project and modify relevant parts to fit your project.
