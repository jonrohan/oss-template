# Open source software template

This is the basic config you'll need in a repository on GitHub for an open source project.

I'm trying to keep this as generic as possible, with more focused forks of this repository listed below.

* [CSS open source software template](https://github.com/jonrohan/css-oss-template)
* [Node.js open source software template](https://github.com/jonrohan/nodejs-oss-template)

Suggestions welcome read over the [contributing](/CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines.
